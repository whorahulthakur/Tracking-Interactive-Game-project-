The Hand-Tracking Game uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to let players control a circle on the screen using hand gestures via a webcam. The goal is to collide with a target that moves randomly after each hit. Itâ€™s lightweight, accessible, and demonstrates real-time gesture control with potential applications in gaming, education, and therapy.
